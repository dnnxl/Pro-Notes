# Processing Notebook
This repository is to save and keep tracking of my processing examples. Here are some examples made in simulation of natural systems class, and also creative work made it by me. 



## Installation
This is how we install the github examples in this repository. This are the following steps:
* Click the green button 'Clone or download' in the right side of the window. 
* Copy the link https://github.com/dnnxl/Processing-Notebook.git or click download in the button.
* And download the examples packages using the link.

## Requirements
* Processing software version 3.0.0 or greater
* Processing libraries needed: PeasyCam, ControlP5 and GifMaker(not necessarily).

## Examples
Here are some examples of processing small projects. Also some homeworks and practices made it in the simulation of natural systems.

### 1. Agent Circle
- First create a class agent, then a system of agents(is represented as an arraylist of agents) of 10000 agents. 
- In a random position in x and y dependent on the width and height of the window. 
- Each agent has a initial velocity in a random 2D vector, with a coefficient of 0.01. 
- To start the simulation it has to touch the space in the keyboard and you will see the simulation start. 
- It applies force of 0.09 to each draw method called.
